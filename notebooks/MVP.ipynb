    "The goal of this project is to build a recommendation system for movies based on user preferences and historical data. The project involves several key steps:\n",
    "- Data Collection\n",
    "- Data Cleaning and Transformation (ETL)\n",
    "- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
    "- Model Development\n",
    "- API Development\n",

    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Collection**: The datasets used in this project are `movies_dataset.csv` and `credits.csv`, which contain information about movies and their respective credits.\n",
    "2. **Data Cleaning and Transformation**: The ETL process is implemented in `src/etl.py`, where data is loaded, cleaned, and transformed into a suitable format for analysis.\n",
    "3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: The EDA is performed in `notebooks/EDA.ipynb`, where various visualizations and statistics are generated to understand the dataset better.\n",
    "4. **Model Development**: The recommendation system is built in `src/model.py`, utilizing machine learning techniques to provide personalized movie recommendations.\n",
    "5. **API Development**: A FastAPI application is set up in `src/api.py` to expose endpoints for interacting with the recommendation system.\n",
    "6. **Testing and Validation**: Unit tests are created in the `tests` directory to ensure the functionality and accuracy of the ETL processes, API endpoints, and recommendation model."
